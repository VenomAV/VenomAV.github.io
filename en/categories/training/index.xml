      <description>&amp;ldquo;What matters is the journey&amp;rdquo; (cit. Stefano Leli). This is the essence of Coderetreat.
I discovered this format during Urbino&amp;rsquo;s Italian Agile Day 2017. During that event, I enjoyed practicing Test Driven Development (TDD) with other participants, and learning from the facilitators Matteo Vaccari, Stefano Leli and Gabriele Tondi. I liked the format so much that I decided to propose it in Florence, where I live, in order to let developers of my community to enjoy it and have fun together.</description>

      <description>I was inspired to such an extent by Evans&amp;rsquo; Blue Book, that I got passionate about Domain-Driven Design. I was still in the United States when, four months in advance, I registered to the Strategic Domain-Driven Design workshop held by Alberto Brandolini (aka ziobrando) and organized by Avanscoperta. I definitely wanted to attend.
Then, taken from the day to day activities, I lost the sense of time, when mid-October, I received an email from Avanscoperta that reminded me of the upcoming course.</description>
