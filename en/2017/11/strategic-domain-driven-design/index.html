<p>I was inspired to such an extent by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Evans&rsquo; Blue Book</a>,
that I got passionate about Domain-Driven Design. I was still in the United States
when, four months in advance, I registered to the Strategic Domain-Driven Design
workshop held by Alberto Brandolini (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/zibrando">ziobrando</a>)
and organized by <a href="https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/training/domain-driven-design-modelling-workshop/">Avanscoperta</a>.
I definitely wanted to attend.</p>

<p>Then, taken from the day to day activities, I lost the sense of time, when mid-October,
I received an email from Avanscoperta that reminded me of the upcoming course. I
felt like someone had given me a weekend at the spa!</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-develop-software">What does it mean to develop software?</h2>

<p>One of the first interactive activities proposed by Alberto, was to define software
developer role using other &ldquo;professions&rdquo; as a metaphor. The most popular professions
identified by the class were the architect, and the craftsman, while ziobrando proposed
roles that were not immediate but very suitable:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>the artificer</strong>: when we have to manipulate code written by someone who &ldquo;no longer
deals with the project&rdquo;;</li>
<li><strong>the Fifth Beatles</strong>: that is the one that everyone blames when there is an
issue, while is invisible when everything work as expected;</li>
<li><strong>the cartoonist</strong>: we often have predefined deadlines, and we have to be creative
in using our art to maximize the result in the remaining time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The artificer is the metaphor that impressed me most. I have recalled the times (many
times) when I was asked to work on existing applications and solve challenging problems
without any kind of test support. And thinking back about those situations, I wonder
how I didn&rsquo;t end up as Dylan did in the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodi_di_Grey%27s_Anatomy_(seconda_stagione)#/media/File:Grey%27s_anatomy_2.png">17th episode of the second season of Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy</a>!</p>

<p>This chat has led Alberto to present and explain his model of software development,
whose skillful illustration is shown below.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/001-software-development-model.jpg"
         alt="ziobrando&#39;s software development model"/> 
</figure>


<p>This model represents software development as a cocktail of four components: build,
learn, decide and wait/nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>: this could be considered the simplest, and less enjoyable part of software
development. This phase starts when we know exactly what we need to do, and how we
have to do it. This is the most deterministic and plannable part of our work,
which best fits a waterfall approach. If it was not for the other components, each
software project could be managed following the same deterministic approach as building
construction.</p>

<p><strong>Learn</strong>: when we start a new project our ignorance is high. We ignore what the
customer really wants, we do not know the best way to solve the problem, and which
architecture is the most appropriate. Usually, during the lifecycle of a project
we gather inputs that allow us to learn and clarify key aspects, while our ignorance
decreases. Note that people maximize their learning when are unstressed and not afraid,
because stress and fear are learning inhibitors. Moreover, learning is not linear
in respect of time. For this reason, development team must feel free to invest time
to deepen the most critical aspects of the project, whether technical or not technical.</p>

<p><strong>Decide</strong>: we take decisions continuously, whether they are related to a pattern
to use, the usability of an interface, or system architecture. The previous section
highlights the fact that we often have to make decisions even if there is lack of
information or we ignore some of the factors that, instead, should be considered
for being able to take better decisions. Therefore, we must try to put ourselves
in the state in which our decisions are reversible. Further, we must try to postpone
relevant decisions as far as possible. That is when our knowledge is
the best possible, and decisions are still valuable to the project.

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/002-decisions.jpg"
         alt="Decisions and ignorance"/> 
</figure>
</p>

<p><strong>Waiting/Nothing</strong>: we often spend our time waiting for someone or something.
Maybe we wait because we lack information or test data. Or we wait someone else to
finish a development in order to start our task. This is clearly a waste of time
that we can, and we must optimize. Fortunately, there are precious tools, eg. Lean
and Kanban, who can help us to address these issues. The resolution of this kind
of problem lets developers focus on the real challenges of project, and to
address them to the fullest.</p>

<p>Each company mixes these four components in its own way. Obviously, there
are more effective proportions then others. This made me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroni">Negroni</a>
(my favorite pre/dinner Italian cocktail) cause using the same ingredients you can
serve the best cocktail ever, or the worst undrinkable mix!</p>

<h2 id="strategic-ddd-in-a-nutshell">Strategic DDD in a nutshell</h2>

<p>Before going toward the most interactive part of the course, Alberto made a brief
introduction to the strategic concepts of DDD, highlighting when it is valuable pursuing
this methodology.</p>

<p>DDD requires commitment in terms of time and effort from the development team
and business. For this reason it makes sense to apply it only to those projects with
high added value: complex and/or evolving domains, i.e. for those domains where it
is very challenging to find the right solution at the first attempt. In these cases,
the effort required by the constant refinement of language and models, both peculiar
of DDD, is justified by the increased capabilities to pursue the ever-changing business
needs.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/003-following-business.jpg"
         alt="Following the business"/> 
</figure>


<p>For such complex projects, the real challenge is to be able to align our code with
our domain understanding, and both with the real domain which is constantly evolving.
If we can keep the code, the understanding we have, and business expectations aligned,
we have the chance to respond quickly, and effectively to the market trends and new
business requirements. Otherwise our project is going to fail as soon as the external
changes are sudden enough to not let development team be able to fulfil new business
requests in the available timeframe. DDD provides two very powerful tools to keep
valuable alignment: <em>Ubiquitous Language</em> and <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>

<p>As the name itself says, Ubiquitous Language requires a single omnipresent language
within the project. The language has to be the one of domain experts and <strong>not</strong> of technical
experts. Also the code should reflect that language: in this way the code will effectively
communicate its intent, and will be more easy to understand and maintain it. Ultimately,
less translation between the language used from business and technical people, extremely
improve the effectiveness of communication.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to expect that everyone within an organization
uses the same terms with the same meaning. Even with &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; terms, same word can
be interpreted in <a href="https://twitter.com/malk_zameth/status/928974920276697088">very different ways in different contexts</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/005-tomatos.jpg"
         alt="Tomatos"/> 
</figure>


<p>To solve this problem, it is essential to use Bounded Context.
A Bounded Context is a linguistic boundary within which every term has only one well-defined
meaning.</p>

<p>DDD requires developers to use a clear business oriented language which has to be
reflected also in the source code. This assumption led me to the following question:
if we are working with domain experts who speak Italian, should we &ldquo;program&rdquo; in Italian?
The answer is much more articulate than you might expect! Analyzing the topic with
ziobrando, it came out different shades.</p>

<p>Even if the programming languages are Anglophones
(<code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, getter, setter, etc.), it should not be an impediment for using the
terms of Ubiquitous Language. Therefore, a method named such as <em>SetIndirizzoSpedizione</em>
(&ldquo;indirizzo spedizione&rdquo; means shipping address) is acceptable if you can increase
code comprehensibility w.r.t the related domain.</p>

<p>What if the business speaks Italian but developers don’t? In this case we should
find a solution that keeps in place an effective communication with domain experts,
and, at the same time, allows developers to easily understand the code. For example,
we could build a shared glossary of terms that contain translations of the language
used by business experts and by developers.</p>

<p>This leads to another question: is there a translation for each concept expressed
by the business? For example, there are business concepts that can be expressed in
Italian, and cannot be translated in English due to cultural/laws diversity.</p>

<p>In DDD this &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; problem had yet to be addressed systematically.
Note that <a href="https://twitter.com/ericevans0">Eric Evans</a> is American, and probably
he has always worked with teams and domains where English was the only language used.</p>

<p>Again, the continuous knowledge increase within the developers team, and the adoption
of a single and not ambiguous language using terms that represent business concepts,
are essential for the success of a project.
What tools do we have to reach these ambitious goals? To answer this question, ziobrando
presented a tool invented by him: <em>Big Picture EventStorming</em>.</p>

<h2 id="big-picture-eventstorming">Big Picture EventStorming</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the subtitle of ziobrando’s book, <a href="http://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming">Introducing EventStorming</a>,
EventStorming is &ldquo;An act of Deliberate Collective Learning&rdquo;. In particular, it is
a tool that allows you to explore/model a whole domain/business and to share
knowledge. If we assemble in the same room people who have the knowledge, who make
the right questions, and someone who facilitates the discussion, we can holistically
model an entire business process which can be used as a tool to better prioritize
activities, and take decisions.</p>

<p>To explain how EventStorming works, and to let us savor what it could mean to participate
in a real modeling session, Alberto engaged us in a role playing game: he chose the
Italian primary train operator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenitalia">Trenitalia</a>,
and he assigned to each of us a role to play (stationmaster, passenger, etc.).</p>

<p>Prior to start this real modeling session, we had to arrange the logistics in the
room with two simple components:</p>

<ul>
<li>an <strong>almost unlimited modeling surface</strong>, in our case at least ten meters of wall!</li>
<li>a tons of <strong>orange sticky-notes</strong>, on which to write the events of the domain,
with verbs in past tense, and temporally ordered on the available surface (from
left to right).</li>
</ul>

<p>Without going into the details, for which I recommend to participate to Alberto&rsquo;s
workshop, after four hours of work we managed to shape a slice of Trenitalia&rsquo;s business,
including the views of all the actors involved.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/006-big-picture-eventstorming.jpg"
         alt="Big Picture EventStorming"/> 
</figure>


<p>Beyond the impressive visual impact, which nevertheless gives satisfaction, the exercise
allowed us to:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a clear <em>value chain</em> and  business processes understanding with the narration
made through domain events;</li>
<li>capture the <em>definition of specific domain terms</em>. We utilized sticky-notes with
rows, and we placed them below the modeling surface;</li>
<li>highlight all the <em>critical nesses</em> of the system (fuchsia sticky-notes), whether
due to misalignments between business areas, customer experience or something else;</li>
<li>propose <em>possible improvements</em> to the system (acid green sticky-notes&hellip; btw,
initially I thought was a sort of yellow&hellip; and for that I felt color blind throughout
the workshop!)</li>
<li>identify clearly who are the <em>people involved</em> in the various streams (small yellow
sticky-notes);</li>
<li>identify the <em>external systems</em> with which our business is interacting (big pink
sticky-notes).</li>
</ul>

<p>All the information, visible at a glance, allowed us to easily spot issues/opportunities
to be addressed with the highest priority. The choice was done with a vote in dot
voting style (small blue stickies). The most interesting aspect is that there has
been consensus when we were requested to vote on the critical issues.
This is due to the power of sharing. An EventStorming session inevitably leads to
a strong alignment in understanding business priorities.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/andreavallotti/image/upload/blog/images/ddd-workshop/007-arrows-cluster.jpg"
         alt="Arrow cluster"/> 
</figure>


<p>This clustering of choices created strong engagement and commitment of all participants
to solve the identified problems.</p>

<p>Since the discussion may raise some conflicts between the participants, it is crucial
to have a facilitator who can help with the comparison and maximize the contribution
of all participants.</p>

<p>EventStorming is definitely a powerful tool to have in your toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="process-modeling-eventstorming">Process Modeling EventStorming</h2>

<p>During the second day of the workshop, Alberto changed the focus of our analysis.
Having now clear the business priorities, as a result of the previous day, we selected
a problem and we have thoroughly analyzed it with the aim of designing the software
needed to solve the problem itself. To do this we relied again on EventStorming.
In particular, in another variant named: <em>Process Modeling</em>. The scope of such modeling
can be an epic or a feature.</p>

<p>We relied on the same components: wide surface for the modeling, and orange sticky-notes
representing domain events. This time with a different goal: find,
and design, the solution to a specific problem. To do this we started by creating
a skeleton of domain events related to the problem under examination, and then we
tried to connect the events by building a consistent narration using the following
elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>users</em>, small yellow sticky-notes, or people interacting with the system;</li>
<li><em>commands/decisions/actions</em>, blue sticky-notes, taken by users in response to
some need or stimulus (see read model below);</li>
<li><em>system</em>, large pink sticky-notes, which modify their state following user actions;</li>
<li><em>domain events</em>, orange sticky-notes, generated by systems as a result of state
changes;</li>
<li><em>read model</em>, green acid sticky-notes, built from events.</li>
</ul>

<p>In turn, the read model, can be further stimulate the user to take other decisions
and then modeling can continue following the same pattern.</p>

<p>An exception to this flow is the reactive logic that can be present in the process.
For example, the system can send automatically an email after a ticket sale, or a
ticket controller must do the fine after a failed verification. These examples are
both policies which must be identified in the modeling process. The difference between
the two, is that the first will be implemented in the code while the second is a
rule which the ticket controller must apply autonomously and which is still part
of the process.</p>

<p>To make more efficient the modeling, we first analyzed the simplest case, that is,
where the interaction between the user and the system is more linear. For example,
thinking about purchasing an online train ticket, we should analyze the case when
there are available sits, user pays with a valid card, etc.</p>

<p>During the modeling of the simple case, we marked potential alternatives (e.g. invalid
credit card) with fuchsia sticky-notes. As soon as we completed the analysis of the
simple case flow, we came back on our steps to analyze the most significant alternative.
This process can be repeated until you cover the most significant scenarios. To do
this kind of assessment it is always useful to have a Product Owner, or any domain
expert, who participates in the modeling phase.</p>

<p>An important aspect we captures during this session was the value created or lost
for all users involved in the various steps of our solution. This is very important
to verify that the solution identified to solve the original problem, as a whole,
increases the value to the system.</p>

<p>Another very important aspect of this session was the attention we paid in refining
the language used. This was essential to define clearly and unambiguously concepts
during the modeling.</p>

<p>The second day ended with a closer look at Context Mapping and the relationships
that may exist between the different contexts in a domain: Partnership, Shared Kernel,
Customer/Supplier, Conformist, Anticorruption Layer, Open-Host Service, Published
Language, Separate Ways and Big Ball of Mud. You can find many details on this subject
in Eric Evans’s book <a href="http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/reference/">DDD Reference</a>, and
many other online resources.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>During the third day of the workshop, Alberto retraced the evolution of architectures
from the publication of the first book on Domain-Driven Design to date, with a focus
on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a>.</p>

<p>It is impressive to note how the DDD remained the same in its core concepts, while
the way developers build applications and the available technologies have drastically
changed. This is definitely due to the robustness of the approach and the attention
given to the creation of a model that is infrastructure and technology agnostic.</p>

<p>CQRS and Event Sourcing definitely deserve an in-depth practical examples, and my
next post will be on these topics.</p>

Therefore, last March I attended &ldquo;Lean and Functional Domain Modelling&rdquo; workshop, organized by Avanscoperta, and held by Marcello Duarte. The workshop gave me good hints about functional modeling and fueled my curiosity to learn Scala and experiment more this paradigm.
In order to tackle this challenge I studied and practiced a lot. After some months, and several discussions with Matteo Baglini, I have been able to put together the puzzle, and I wrote this post.</div>

I definitely wanted to attend.
Then, taken from the day to day activities, I lost the sense of time, when mid-October, I received an email from Avanscoperta that reminded me of the upcoming course.</div>
