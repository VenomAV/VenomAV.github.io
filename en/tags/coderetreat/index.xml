      <description>&amp;ldquo;What matters is the journey&amp;rdquo; (cit. Stefano Leli). This is the essence of Coderetreat.
I discovered this format during Urbino&amp;rsquo;s Italian Agile Day 2017. During that event, I enjoyed practicing Test Driven Development (TDD) with other participants, and learning from the facilitators Matteo Vaccari, Stefano Leli and Gabriele Tondi. I liked the format so much that I decided to propose it in Florence, where I live, in order to let developers of my community to enjoy it and have fun together.</description>
